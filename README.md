### Building A Social Nav Bar

Lets start out by making a new feature branch in Terminal by typing `git checkout -b social-icons` and press return. 

...




It's now time to version our changes using Git. To do so, in Terminal type `git add .` and press return. Then type `git commit -m "finish social icons"` and press return. Then push up this feature branch `git push -u origin social-icons` and press return. Next merge the changes into your master branch. Type `git checkout master` and press return, then `git merge social-icons` and press return. Then `git push origin master` and press return.

After you finish, make sure you install Firefox if you haven't already as it is required for the screenshot tests to run. Then, type learn command from Terminal to run local tests (Mac) or type learn-test for Windows.

After all tests are passing submit a pull request on Github and move on to the next lesson!
